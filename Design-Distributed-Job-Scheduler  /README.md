# Design a Distributed Job Scheduler

## Fun. / Non-Fun. Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **Job Submission:**
     * Users should be able to submit jobs to the scheduler.
     * Support for different job types (e.g., one-time, recurring).
     * Ability to specify job execution time and frequency.
2. **Job Management:**
     * Users can view, update, or cancel scheduled jobs.
     * Support for job prioritization.
     * Ability to pause and resume jobs.
3. **Job Execution:**
    * Execute jobs at the specified time.
    * Support for distributed execution across multiple nodes.
    * Ensure job execution reliability and consistency.
4. **Job Monitoring and Logging:**
    * Provide real-time status updates for jobs.
    * Log job execution details and history.
    * Alert users on job failures or delays.
5. **Scalability:**
    * Handle a large number of concurrent job submissions and executions.
    * Support for horizontal scaling to accommodate increased load.
6. **Security:**
    * Authenticate and authorize users for job submission and management.
    * Ensure data privacy and integrity during job execution.
7. **Fault Tolerance:**
    * Automatically retry failed jobs. 
    * Ensure system availability in case of node failures.
8. **API Access:**
   * Provide RESTful APIs for job submission, management, and monitoring.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**
   * Low latency in job scheduling and execution.
   * Efficient resource utilization to minimize execution time.
2. **Reliability:**
   * High availability with minimal downtime.
   * Ensure job execution even in the event of partial system failures.
3. **Scalability:**
   * Ability to scale horizontally to support increasing job loads.
   * Efficient load balancing across distributed nodes.
4. **Consistency:**
   * Ensure data consistency across distributed components.
   * Provide eventual consistency for job status updates.
5. **Resilience:**
   * System should recover gracefully from failures.
   * Implement redundancy to prevent data loss.
6. **Security:**
   * Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS).
   * Implement role-based access control for job management.
7. **Observability:**
   * Provide comprehensive logging and monitoring.
   * Enable easy tracking of job execution metrics and system health.
8. **Extensibility:**
   * Design the system to accommodate future feature additions.
   * Support for plugin-based architecture for custom job types.
